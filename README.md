# The-Complex-Calculator-for-Linux-and-MacOSX

A WIP Calculator made in Python 3, this requires you to download Python 3 and run this app with it, 
download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you don't want to download or you want to run it on a chromebook or something, use the web client,
it's always updated to the latest version and it can be found near the top of either TCC fork.

UPDATE: This repo will be archived from now on, and I will no longer be committing to it.

All old files have been moved to the new repo available on the repos page, and all future updates will appear there too.
