# The-Complex-Calculator-for-Windows

A WIP Calculator made in Python 3, this requires you to download Python 3 and run this app with it, 
download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you don't want to do all of that, or you want to run this on a chromebook or something, run the web client,
it's always updated to the latest version and it can be found at the top of either TCC fork.
